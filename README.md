# RescueMeter

I have a bad habit of spending way too much time on screens. RescueMeter is an experimental service to help me and my friends cut down on our screen time by agreeing to pay a set amount of money per hour of screen time.

## Sign up

0. Sign up for [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) and install it on all your devices.
0. Sign up for [TaskRatchet](https://taskratchet.com/) so I have your payment details on file.
0. Submit [this form](https://forms.gle/DSarJFhKJXD1YeUd9) using the email address you used to register with TaskRatchet.

## What happens next?

Once you're all registered, I'll email you once a month to ask you how much time you spent on screens, according to the rules you set in the form, for the previous calendar month. Once you reply I'll then charge you an amount of money equal to that number multiplied by the rate you provided.

## What if I want to cancel?

You can email me at nathan@taskratchet.com to cancel at any time, effective the next calendar month from when you canceled. So if you email me on June 15 to cancel, I will still attempt to charge you for June 15, but will not charge you for July or any subsequent months.

## I still have questions, comments, or ideas.

I'm eager to hear from you! Please email me at nathan@taskratchet.com
